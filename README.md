# FantasticStoriesWeb
Web version of Fantastic Stories App which allows to review s-f and fantasy stories from "Nowa Fantastyka" 
(the biggest and oldest Polish magazine focused on that kind of literature) via web browser. 
App uses postgresql database that is recreated and populated by sample data on each launch of the app, 
so if you want to test it on your computer, just define a connection witn an empty database in application.properties.
You can test my app on heroku: https://fantastic-stories-web.herokuapp.com/
